`path.sh` is a bash function for interactive manipulation of search paths, like `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH`.

To use it, simply source `path.sh`, possibly in your `~/.bashrc`.  

On systems with bash older than version 4 (that would be OSX), source `path-v3.sh` instead.

Invoke `path --help` for usage info.
